# What-I-Learned-In-Week-11
### Objects
* `delete anObject.lastName` - will delete the key in an object. It's not common but nice to know.
* `if ('key' in obj)` - the in operator will check if the key is in an object. You can run code based on this logic.

### Function Expressions
```
const subtract = function(x, y) {
    return x - y;
}
```
Anonymous Functions are set as a variable. The advantages are that functions are values and that the variable is set to a const. Order matters because the function is a variable.

### HTML CSS DOM
* multiple classes!
* DOM token list methods for `classList`
* You can manipulate the DOM with classes by replacing it with another class name and make it dynamic by toggling certain filters or settings.

### Projects
* An Objectively Challenging Game
* Just How We Roll
* BS Paint

### Notes
* Trailing commas will help arrange syntax.
* `arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)` - functionally programming will compare the array items in a pair and if they are pos/neg will sort accordingly.
* `Array.from(elementID.classList)` - will turn a string into an array.
